/*Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of the smallest string which has both s1 and s2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: s1 and s2 can have both uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "eke"
Output: 5
Explanation: String "geeke" has both string "geek" and "eke" as subsequences.
